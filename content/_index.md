# Why eat SHT?

When it comes to sustainable and nutritious protein sources, crickets are emerging as a frontrunner for several compelling reasons:

- **Nutrient Density:** Crickets are a complete protein, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids. They're also rich in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and B vitamins. In fact, cricket flour can contain up to 65-70% protein, with some brands providing as much as 21 grams of protein per 28-gram serving.
- **Water Usage:** The water footprint for crickets is considerably lower. It's estimated that producing one kilogram of cricket protein requires less than 1% of the water that beef does.
- **Land Efficiency:** Crickets require far less land than traditional livestock. This means that not only do they have a lower environmental footprint, but they also offer potential solutions to land scarcity challenges as our global population grows.
- **Carbon Footprint:** Livestock farming is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions. Crickets, on the other hand, produce 80 times less methane than cattle, making them a more environmentally friendly protein source. Crickets are exceptionally efficient at converting feed into protein. They require 12 times less feed than cattle, 4 times less than sheep, and half as much as pigs and broiler chickens to produce the same amount of protein.
- **Ethical Protein:** With advancements in farming techniques, crickets can be raised and harvested humanely, offering an alternative for those concerned about the ethical treatment of larger livestock.

In a world facing the challenges of climate change, population growth, and increasing demands on our natural resources, crickets offer a promising solution as a protein source that's not only nutritious but also environmentally friendly, efficient, and sustainable. **[Join Us!](#get-this-sht)**

# About Us

We, the Founders (Steven, Yoona, Aaron, Thomas, and Chad), met during our first year as MBA students at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. We have taken various business courses together and joined venture competitions where we utilized what we have learned to deliver quality group work and develop business plans. During an entrepreneurship and business development course, Steven pitched an idea involving cricket supplements due to their nutrient-dense qualities and sustainability. We became intrigued with using crickets as an ingredient in food products. Therefore, we created this group and company to explore this novel idea further and are determined to introduce sustainable, innovative snacks with unique ingredients to Western audiences. As Founders, we possess a wide range of knowledge, experience, and industry expertise, with a common interest in health, wellness, and environmental sustainability. This is why we created SHT Snacks.

Global attitudes towards healthy snacking are evolving, and a new, innovative product is poised to upend eating habits to usher in a new frontier in the Western diet. SHT Snacks’ Cricket Chips is a healthy snacking chip that revitalizes, delights, and keeps the earth spinning. SHT Snacks Cricket Chips leverage a proprietary formula to thread the needle in delivering health, taste, and sustainability. Cricket protein is recognized as a sustainable and nutritious alternative to traditional protein sources, and this chip offers a unique and delicious way for adventurous snackers to incorporate it into their diet and make the world just a little better - one bite at a time.

We hope you'll become as big a **[fan of SHT](#get-this-sht)** as we are!
